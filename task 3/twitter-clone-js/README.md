## About The Project

![Twitter Clone projesi görseli](./assets/gif/twitter-project.gif/)

The Twitter Clone project was developed to improve my technical skills. The design, customized based on a reference from [Figma](<https://www.figma.com/file/AO2YCTIlVBx8uK1ynEsERY/twitter-web-(Community)?node-id=0-1&t=Cu71RlsPOL3DILEI-0>) and was implemented using JavaScript and TailwindCSS technologies. During the coding process, pixel-perfect and responsive design principles were taken into consideration.

As the reference design did not include a mobile version, a mobile-friendly design was created based on the current version of Twitter. This decision led to the inclusion of the mobile version in the project at a later stage.

### Features

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and can be used on all device sizes, including mobile devices.

- **Pixel Perfect:** The application's design is created with pixel-perfect precision.

- **Effective Use of TailwindCSS:** The project makes effective use of the TailwindCSS library and minimizes the repetition of CSS code.

- **Effective Use of JavaScript:** The project actively uses JavaScript and increases the application's dynamism using a range of JS features, including DOM manipulation, event listeners, and classes. The data is dynamically mapped into an array and processed dynamically into HTML.

- **Active Usage of GitHub and Git:** The project is actively developed using Git version control and is hosted on GitHub, which provides version management.

### Built With
